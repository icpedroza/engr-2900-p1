# engr-2900-p1
We have included several files here based off of what is needed for implementation or to understand our methodology.
main_video.py, facial_rec.py, and facial_det_dnn.py are the main three files that were provided for us to run the facial detection and recognition program. Facial recognition portions have been commented out to be able to run. We have also included the trained_model.pt file which was obtained through our 9 epochs of training. The ENGR_2900_Project_1_Train_Model.ipynb file that was provided to us to train is included as well. There are also two additional files included in save_face_video.py and youtube_capture_main_video. These are not necessary for implementation, but they represent the additional code files we made in order to capture the faces from YouTube inputted videos.
